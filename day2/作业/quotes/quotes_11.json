    "text": "“This life is what you make it. No matter what, you&#39;re going to mess up sometimes, it&#39;s a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how you&#39;re going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - they&#39;ll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - they&#39;re your true best friends. Don&#39;t let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they&#39;ll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can&#39;t give up because if you give up, you&#39;ll never find your soulmate. You&#39;ll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don&#39;t, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life&#39;s a beautiful thing and there&#39;s so much to smile about.”",
